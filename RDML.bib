	abstract = {Summary: The {qpcR} library is an add-on to the free R statistical environment performing sigmoidal model selection in real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction ({PCR}) data analysis. Additionally, the package implements the most commonly used algorithms for real-time {PCR} data analysis and is capable of extensive statistical comparison for the selection and evaluation of the different models based on several measures of goodness of fit.

	abstract = {Recent advances in fluorescent dyes, methods, instruments and software for {DNA} melting analysis have created versatile new tools for variant scanning and genotyping. High resolution melting analysis ({HRM} or {HRMA}) is faster, simpler, and less expensive than alternative approaches requiring separations or labeled probes. With the addition of a saturating dye before {PCR} followed by rapid melting analysis of the {PCR} products, the sensitivity of heterozygote scanning approaches 100\%. Specificity can be increased by identifying common polymorphisms with small amplicon melting, unlabeled probes or snapback primers to decrease the sequencing burden. However, some homozygotes require mixing for identification. Furthermore, different heterozygotes may produce melting curves so similar to each other that, although they clearly vary from homozygous variants, they are not differentiated from each other. Nevertheless, the experimental return for minimal effort is great. This focus issue of Human Mutation includes a concise, timely review on high resolution melting, a comparison to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, integration with {qPCR} for copy number assessment, combined amplicon scanning and unlabeled probe genotyping from a single melting curve, and applications to the mitochondrial genome and to {BRCA}1.

	abstract = {High-resolution melting of {DNA} is a simple solution for genotyping, mutation scanning and sequence matching. The melting profile of a {PCR} product depends on its {GC} content, length, sequence and heterozygosity and is best monitored with saturating dyes that fluoresce in the presence of double-stranded {DNA}. Genotyping of most variants is possible by the melting temperature of the {PCR} products, while all variants can be genotyped with unlabeled probes. Mutation scanning and sequence matching depend on sequence differences that result in heteroduplexes that change the shape of the melting curve. High-resolution {DNA} melting has several advantages over other genotyping and scanning methods, including an inexpensive closed tube format that is homogenous, accurate and rapid. Owing to its simplicity and speed, the method is a good fit for personalized medicine as a rapid, inexpensive method to predict therapeutic response.},

	abstract = {Background: Currently, a lack of consensus exists on how best to perform and interpret quantitative real-time {PCR} ({qPCR}) experiments. The problem is exacerbated by a lack of sufficient experimental detail in many publications, which impedes a reader’s ability to evaluate critically the quality of the results presented or to repeat the experiments.
Content: The Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time {PCR} Experiments ({MIQE}) guidelines target the reliability of results to help ensure the integrity of the scientific literature, promote consistency between laboratories, and increase experimental transparency. {MIQE} is a set of guidelines that describe the minimum information necessary for evaluating {qPCR} experiments. Included is a checklist to accompany the initial submission of a manuscript to the publisher. By providing all relevant experimental conditions and assay characteristics, reviewers can assess the validity of the protocols used. Full disclosure of all reagents, sequences, and analysis methods is necessary to enable other investigators to reproduce results. {MIQE} details should be published either in abbreviated form or as an online supplement.
Summary: Following these guidelines will encourage better experimental practice, allowing more reliable and unequivocal interpretation of {qPCR} results.},
