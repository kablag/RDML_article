	abstract = {Recent advances in fluorescent dyes, methods, instruments and software for {DNA} melting analysis have created versatile new tools for variant scanning and genotyping. High resolution melting analysis ({HRM} or {HRMA}) is faster, simpler, and less expensive than alternative approaches requiring separations or labeled probes. With the addition of a saturating dye before {PCR} followed by rapid melting analysis of the {PCR} products, the sensitivity of heterozygote scanning approaches 100\%. Specificity can be increased by identifying common polymorphisms with small amplicon melting, unlabeled probes or snapback primers to decrease the sequencing burden. However, some homozygotes require mixing for identification. Furthermore, different heterozygotes may produce melting curves so similar to each other that, although they clearly vary from homozygous variants, they are not differentiated from each other. Nevertheless, the experimental return for minimal effort is great. This focus issue of Human Mutation includes a concise, timely review on high resolution melting, a comparison to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, integration with {qPCR} for copy number assessment, combined amplicon scanning and unlabeled probe genotyping from a single melting curve, and applications to the mitochondrial genome and to {BRCA}1.

The melting profile of a {PCR} product depends on its {GC} content, length, sequence and heterozygosity and is best monitored with saturating dyes that fluoresce in the presence of double-stranded {DNA}. Genotyping of most variants is possible by the melting temperature of the {PCR} products, while all variants can be genotyped with unlabeled probes. Mutation scanning and sequence matching depend on sequence differences that result in heteroduplexes that change the shape of the melting curve.

Content: The Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time {PCR} Experiments ({MIQE}) guidelines target the reliability of results to help ensure the integrity of the scientific literature, promote consistency between laboratories, and increase experimental transparency. {MIQE} is a set of guidelines that describe the minimum information necessary for evaluating {qPCR} experiments. Included is a checklist to accompany the initial submission of a manuscript to the publisher. By providing all relevant experimental conditions and assay characteristics, reviewers can assess the validity of the protocols used. Full disclosure of all reagents, sequences, and analysis methods is necessary to enable other investigators to reproduce results. {MIQE} details should be published either in abbreviated form or as an online supplement.
Summary: Following these guidelines will encourage better experimental practice, allowing more reliable and unequivocal interpretation of {qPCR} results.},

The high resolution melting ({HRM}) diversity assay was developed to quantify {HIV} diversity in viral populations without sequencing. In this assay, {HIV} diversity is expressed as a single numeric {HRM} score that represents the width of a melting peak. {HRM} scores are highly associated with diversity measures obtained with next generation sequencing. In this report, a software package, the {HRM} Diversity Assay Analysis Tool ({DivMelt}), was developed to automate calculation of {HRM} scores from melting curve data.{MethodsDivMelt} uses computational algorithms to calculate {HRM} scores by identifying the start (T1) and end (T2) melting temperatures for a {DNA} sample and subtracting them (T2–T1 = {HRM} score). {DivMelt} contains many user-supplied analysis parameters to allow analyses to be tailored to different contexts. {DivMelt} analysis options were optimized to discriminate between recent and non-recent {HIV} infection and to maximize {HRM} score reproducibility. {HRM} scores calculated using {DivMelt} were compared to {HRM} scores obtained using a manual method that is based on visual inspection of {DNA} melting curves.{ResultsHRM} scores generated with {DivMelt} agreed with manually generated {HRM} scores obtained from the same {DNA} melting data. Optimal parameters for discriminating between recent and non-recent {HIV} infection were identified. {DivMelt} provided greater discrimination between recent and non-recent {HIV} infection than the manual method.{ConclusionDivMelt} provides a rapid, accurate method of determining {HRM} scores from melting curve data, facilitating use of the {HRM} diversity assay for large-scale studies.},
