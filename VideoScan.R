  "qPCR Experiment for the amplification of MLC-2v using the VideoScan heating/cooling-unit. The aim was to amplify MLC-2v in the VideoScan and to monitor with a hydrolysis probe for MLC-2v. The primer sequences for MLC-2v were taken from Roediger et al. (2013). The amplification was detected in solution of the 1 HCU (see Roediger et al. 2013 for details). A 20 micro L PCR reaction was composed of 250 nM primer (forward and reverse), 1x Maxima Probe qPCR Master Mix (Fermentas), 1 micro L template (MLC-2v amplification product in different dilutions), 50 nM hydrolysis probe probe for MLC-2v and A. bidest. During the amplification, fluorescence was measured at 59.5 degree Celsius. The Cy5 channel was used to monitor the MLC-2v specific hydrolysis probe. Input stock cDNA was used undiluted (D1). D2 was 1/1000 and D3 1/1000000 diluted in A. bidest. The D1, D2, and D3 have different numbers measure points and D2 contains a missing value at cycle 37."
